## Config:
**If you just want to use the default config values you don't need to add a config at all.**

If you want to modify the configuration, place it in the root of your dashboard configuration under the `swipe_nav` element (see example below).

**Config Options:**

| Name                |  Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |

| animate             | string  | `none`  | Swipe animations. Can be: `none`, `swipe`, `fade`, `flip`. The swipe animation should be considered experimental and depending on your setup may appear buggy.                 |
| animate_duration    | number  |  `200`  | Swipe animation's duration in milliseconds.                                                                                                                                    |
| disable_on_subviews | boolean | `false` | Disables swipe navigation while on subviews. <br>‚ö†Ô∏è _Note the difference between this and `skip_subviews`, which skips over subviews while navigating **from** regular views._  |
| enable              | boolean | `true`  | Enable or disable the swipe navigation.                                                                                                                                        |
| enable_mouse_swipe  | boolean | `false` | Enable or disable the swipe navigation via mouse.                                                                                                                              |
| logger_level        | string  | `warn`  | Set logging level. Possible values are: `verbose`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.                                                                                           |
| prevent_default     | boolean | `false` | Prevent the browsers default horizontal swipe actions.                                                                                                                         |
| skip_subviews       | boolean | `true`  | Automatically skip subviews.                                                                                                                                                   |
| skip_tabs           | string  |         | A comma separated list of views to skip when swiping. e.g., `1,3,5`.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è _Note that tabs count starts at `0`, so the first is `0`, second is `1`, and so on._                 |
| swipe_amount        | number  |  `15`   | Minimum percent of screen needed to be swiped in order to navigate.                                                                                                            |
| wrap                | boolean | `true`  | Wrap from first tab to last tab and vice versa.                                                                                                                                |
| ~~skip_hidden~~     | boolean | `true`  | Automatically skip hidden tabs.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è _Setting this to `false` is deprecated and poses a security risk as it allows a user to reveal a tab they don't have access to._          |


**Example:**

Don't just copy the example, it won't fit your needs. Build your own using the config options above.

```yaml
# You don't necessarily need a configuration.
# Add only the options that differ from the default values.
swipe_nav:
  wrap: false
  enable_mouse_swipe: true
  animate: swipe
  skip_tabs: 5,6,7,8
  prevent_default: true
  swipe_amount: 30
  
views:
```

If you need help, Mark Watt has an excellent video covering the configuration [in this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03IPN9lBEfE&t=663s).
